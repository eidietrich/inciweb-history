Prescribed fire is a proactive tool for several purposes, including reducing hazardous fuels, which decreases the threat of high-intensity, high-severity wildfires.<br /><br />\nIt also reduces the risk of insect and disease outbreaks, recycles nutrients that increase soil productivity, and improves wildlife habitat. The actual days of ignition for prescribed burning will depend on several factors, including appropriate humidity levels, wind speed and direction, temperature, and fuel moisture. Burns only occur on days when weather conditions exist for good smoke dispersal.</p>\n\n<p>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Smoke may be visible, but these fires are all carefully monitored, and local fire departments are aware of prescribed fire activity.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p>In order to reduce the risk of high-intensity wildfire, improve forest health and wildlife habitat, the Bureau of Land Management Tres Rios Field Office has planned a prescribed fire treatment for up to 652 acres on Animas City Mountain in Durango, Colorado. Dependent on weather and the availability of firefighters to conduct the operation, the prescribed burns could take place in spring and fall months. An Environmental Assessment which covers this, as well as other treatment areas in La Plata County, has been completed and is available here: <a href=\"https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1505044/510\">Final Environmental Assessment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires require a comprehensive plan consisting of 21 elements. The plan outlines the methodical process from inception to completion. The Animas City Mountain project is expected to take 2-3 days for ignitions, with additional time to patrol the area and extinguish hot spots. The mountain has been divided into seven units or compartments. Crews are expected to begin burning on the top of the mountain by slowly lighting an edge that has already been thinned with chainsaws. Once a secure edge or “black line” has been established, firefighters ignite the interior of each unit, one unit at a time. The fire then burns back toward the secured, black edge. This methodical approach allows firefighters opportunities to halt ignitions if burning conditions become undesirable. Examples of undesirable conditions are fire behavior that is too active/not active enough, and poor smoke dispersion. Firefighters will also have water on hand to cool things down if fire activity grows beyond a desirable level.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires are watched carefully by firefighters around the burn, lookouts at more distant locations, aerially (helicopters, planes, drones), and with calibrated smoke monitors. These monitors will be placed at locations around the burn to track smoke impacts in real time. The BLM and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Air Quality (CPDHE) have been working since 2018 to develop a permit that accomplishes the burn while minimizing smoke impacts to the surrounding area. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>. Prescribed fires are a tool to minimize smoke impacts to communities by careful selection of when fires burn and when they stop. Firefighters utilize compartments to halt the fire from spreading overnight, whereas wildfire continue to burn overnight when smoke is likely to settle into low lying areas where communities are located. Residual smoke from the interior areas of the compartments is anticipated, but the goal is to start early in the day and stop early in the evening to give material as much time as possible to be consumed before night-time cooling occurs and smoke sinks into the valley.</p>\n\n<p>Ideal timing (windows) for the project occurs during the Spring and Fall when conditions are more favorable for low-intensity fire. Fuel (vegetation) and weather conditions must fall within a predetermined “prescription” that is known to yield desirable results while still being controllable by the fire personnel conducting the burn. Dissipation of smoke is also part of the prescription. Prescription development has been done by local fire experts who utilize fire behavior computer modeling software combined with decades of experience conducting prescribed burn in southwest Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>This project is a coordinated effort between the federal/county/local government, NGOs, emergency managers, fire departments, public health officials, state smoke regulators and nearby residents. The burn is planned to take place over the course of 2-3 days. Brief closure of Animas City Mountain during the ignitions will occur for public and firefighter safety. The containment lines used for the project will consist of BLM designated trails. The units will be ignited using a combination of ground and aerial resources and will be patrolled/mopped up until out.</p>\n\n<p>The project is part of the BLM’s ongoing commitment to protecting human health and safety while maintaining or enhancing forest and woodland health and functionality. The Animas City Mountain area was previously masticated in 2010 which altered the vertical structure of the forest stand to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Mastication is a treatment method where the understory is mowed and mulched with a large machine. The mulched material slowly decomposes, while the understory regrows. Mastication and prescribed fire are effective in preventing fires from leaving the ground and becoming “crown” fires where the entire trees or stand of trees burn. Treatments thin and remove some of the large dense understory or “ladder fuels”.</p>\n\n<p>Vegetation, however, grows back and requires maintenance. Prescribed fire is the best treatment option for this forest type, if possible, after the initial mechanical treatment. While consuming some of the standing vegetation; prescribed fire also eliminates material left on the ground from both mastication and the natural shedding of leaves, needles, etc. Fire is the only natural process used as a treatment method and produces the most effective results for hazardous fuel reduction while enhancing woodland health. Ponderosa pine woodlands are a drought resistant species that have evolved with a natural cycle of frequent, low-intensity fire.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fire mimics this natural process and improves forage for wildlife, as well as increasing plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where grasses and flowers can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Every year the west is impacted by large catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and other treatment methods lessen the impacts of future fires and increase the likelihood firefighters can work safely and be effective at stopping fires in and near treated areas.</p>\n\n<p> </p>",

Fire managers develop burn plans accounting for safety, specific fuel and weather prescriptions and smoke management. All prescribed burns are closely evaluated and are only approved when favorable conditions are present. If conditions change or objectives are not being met a burn may cease. Prescribed burns may affect people sensitive to smoke and may impact access to burn areas and travel routes. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>To learn more about the Southwest Idaho Landscape and the excellent interagency work being conducted visit the interactive map with the latest planned areas of prescribed fire treatments:  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SWIdahoRXFire\">http://bit.ly/SWIdahoRXFire</a>.

Due to dry, windy conditions, fire activity increased, with the largest day of growth On May 10th, spreading north and west. It was typically smoldering with slow growth. However , with changing weather conditions, the fire became more active on May 18th, growing just over 1,000 acres. Several structures and cultural and heritage resources remain threatened, including the Sweetwater Cabin, Juniper Springs Cabin, and Pat’s Island. To protect public safety, several road and area closures are in place. For closure information, go to the <a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-closures/flfnf-major\">Closures</a> page.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>On May 13, 2023, the Southern Area Blue Team Incident Management Team (IMT) assumed command of the fire, transitioning from a local Type 3 IMT. Dry fuels and changing weather conditions may cause additional spread. Fire managers monitor and assess fire conditions to develop and implement a suppression strategy. Crews are currently performing structure protection and holding and improving lines. Smoke may be visible in the surrounding area as weather conditions change.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Public resources: </span></span></span></strong> </span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Daily Fire Updates </span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>can be accessed </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-news/flfnf-major\"><strong>here </strong></a></span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>or through the News tab in the blue bar located in the upper portion of this page.</span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> <strong><span><span><span><span>variety of maps</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> are added daily to the Maps section in the blue bar in the upper portion of this page <strong><a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-maps-gallery/flfnf-major\">here</a>.</strong>  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul>",

Under the umbrella of an Incident Management Organization (IMO), teams of drivers are systematically driving forest roads and assessing damage to roads, recreation sites, or OHV trails. Once located, the sites are turned over to other staff within the IMO equipped with chainsaws and shovels for fallen tree removal or to staff with back-hoe tractors, tracked excavators, and dump trucks. These equipment operators are smoothing out roads, filling erosion holes, cleaning debris from culverts, and generally doing what they can to fix the roads in a timely manner. Damaged sections that require a more substantial repair will be contracted through the Forest Engineer for more specialized contractors to completion.  Larger equipment has been requested to assist with road repairs.  </p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><strong>Winter Road Closures</strong> </span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>A forest closure order remains in effect through June 15th for the Western Divide and Kern River Ranger Districts of the Sequoia National Forest.  Full details available on the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1082404.pdf\">Sequoia National Forest Website.</a> These closures are designed to help protect road surfaces and natural resources.

The spring had been cool, limiting the snowmelt. However, weather forecast for early July has very warm temperatures for the area. This means there's a lot of snow out there to melt and could cause potential flooding and swift, cold water flows.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>California’s historic snowpack is now starting to melt with</span></span></span><span> warming springtime temperatures, causing the levels of creeks, streams, and river</span><span>s to rise significantly and flood some areas. <span><span>According to the National Weather Service, the bulk of the flooding may happen in late May to early August, however it will continue to persist into fall because of the depth and density of the snowpack.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong><span>INYO NATIONAL FOREST SNOWMELT FLOOD INFORMATION</span></strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Inyo National Forest welcomes visitors to enjoy this unusually lush and beautiful spring and summer, but please proceed with caution. Not every trail or road has been surveyed and deemed “safe” to recreate on, so it is up to you to look out for your own safety and plan for any unexpected changes to your trip.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>There is a heightened risk of flooding, landslides, debris flows, road/trail washouts and avalanches.<span><span> And with the combination of extended hot weather and abundant snow means certain areas may remain above flood stage for some time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Creeks and streams will be at higher flows for longer into the year, making them challenging or impossible to cross.

This page also highlights the ongoing storm recovery effort of an established USDA Forest Service Incident Management Organization (IMO) that was implemented January 17 to safely and systematically open storm-damaged areas of the forest for public and emergency responder access. </p>\n\n<p>More information on the 2023 Los Padres National Forest Emergency Flood Recovery can be found at the following websites:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/lpnf\">Los Padres National Forest website</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfsregion5/albums/72177720309579324\">Los Padres Storm Damage and Storm Recovery Flickr Album</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lospadresnationalforest\">Los Padres National Forest Facebook Page</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LosPadresNF\">Los Padres National Forest Twitter Page</a></p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong>INCIDENT BACKGROUND</strong></h2>\n\n<p>A series of winter storms brought heavy rainfall to California and impacted many areas of the Los Padres National Forest as a series of 12 atmospheric rivers hit the west coast from December 2022 through March 2023 (<a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/2023/01/11/atmospheric-rivers-what-are-they-and-how-does-noaa-study-them/\">NOAA atmospheric river</a>). This consistent barrage of rainfall created debris flows that washed out forest roads, buried recreation areas, and left some residences stranded without ingress/egress to their homes.</p>\n\n<p>After the initial powerful storm in January that caused flooding, Los Padres National Forest employees immediately began assessing the damage, and on January 17 an emergency flood response IMO was established. The initial focus was to help residents regain access to their homes. Afterwards, the objectives shifted to safely reopening areas for public and emergency responder personnel, including firefighting vehicles for initial attack and extended attack operations throughout the forest.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>INCIDENT OBJECTIVES</h2>\n\n<ol><li>\n\t<p>Provide for public safety by identifying and mitigating road, trail, and recreational infrastructure damage. Reopen sections of the Forest that are safe for public use.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for safety of agency personnel by identifying and mitigating hazards to administrative sites and ensuring travel routes are safe.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for emergency response preparedness by identifying and mitigating damage to critical infrastructure such as communication towers.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for rapid damage assessment on infrastructure (roads, trails, bridges, buildings, developed recreation sites, etc.) forest wide.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for access to private property, residences and businesses that are located within Forest boundaries.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Coordinate with the Regional Storm Damage Response team as requested. - Actively communicate with the public and elected officials about status of storm damage and mitigation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Coordinate with partners, agencies, and volunteers in storm damage assessment and mitigation activities.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol><h2> </h2>\n\n<h2>CURRENT IMO OPERATIONS</h2>\n\n<p>The Incident Management Organization (IMO) will continue to assess roads, trails and recreation areas. USDA Forest Service equipment operators and contractors will use equipment to repair roads and culverts. Firefighting crews will focus on opening trails while maintaining initial attack readiness in the event of any new wildfire starts.</p>\n\n<p>Resource advisors (READs) will determine potential impacts to plant, animal, cultural, archaeology, engineering, recreation, hydrology and other forest resources prior to beginning work. Assessments, heavy equipment work, and handcrew work is ongoing on the Monterey, Santa Lucia, Santa Barbara, Mt. Pinos and Ojai ranger districts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>CLOSURE INFORMATION BY DISTRICT </strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Los Padres National Forest strongly encourages the public to adhere to closure signs as hazardous conditions are still present on these roads, making travel unsafe and potentially impossible.

The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!",
