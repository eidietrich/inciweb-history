Pile burning helps eliminate branches, limbs, twigs and small logs that can't easily be removed through other means due to topography, access or cost feasibility. Pile burning typically follows forest thinning projects in overgrown forests. If heavy machinery was used to conduct the thinning, the piles may be much larger than if thinning and piling was completed by hand using chainsaws. </span></p><p><span>Before burning piles, fire managers track hyper-localized weather forecasts to check temperatures, snowpack conditions and wind. Snow and cooler temperatures are key tools in helping contain fire behavior while wind is an important factor in aiding smoke dispersal. Firefighters use air quality monitoring stations in areas where they plan on burning.</span></p><p><span>Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Mild fire behavior between piles is expected and is also beneficial for future wildfire risk reduction. This can include forest litter between piles and lower limbs of trees.  Once burning has begun, firefighters patrol and monitor burned piles until there is no longer any heat emitted. </span></p><p><span>This work is part of the </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001GivvFcc-tevUzDYrb0Gg4UpVPrfqSVl4JAAusVwHGRLqUMVRAXqh62er91EqRMexV5h4aIUoB0Yk5CJIEi6z9lLwq-Ydxeub9V334nOSX2nXnq5BrpHeyR0ofshlyQREJm_TLpC4h3eaGamv4e1tGQvPi1Y0ykgD-tOJyaYFUreY6cGA2KIlUYDeTwnG6NhA%26c%3Dp9KqBFwz5AmuJUEREBmnKB7Uubc2Apvfey7W_5_-v6jwmIxlSQc7xg%3D%3D%26ch%3Dcp3EVjrm9p78Ut1VlhMYW2acMfEeS6DsVCfX1tHbtHhsUi5EMFpE8Q%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cvictoria.ibarra%40usda.gov%7C93a28af96c9c49c0ace308dbe172625f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638351653617355410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WBQ7IgL6IwVgqu%2FkJCbEQK%2BlJFwhO1iMxUXqgxiAgpg%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>National Wildfire Crisis Strategy</strong></span></a><span> effort to reduce the impacts of unplanned, large-scale fires on watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and communities.

The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  <br /><br />\nWhile no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. <br /><br />\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>.<br />\n </p>\n\n<p>Specific information on upcoming prescribed burn projects can be found in the News section.</p>",

(October 20,2022) – Fire personnel with the Stanislaus National Forest’s Mi-Wok/Summit Ranger District will conduct prescribed burn operations in the Stanislaus Experimental Forest approximately two miles southeast of the Pinecrest area.</p>\n\n<p>Ignition of the prescribed burn is expected to begin the last week of October and will continue for two to three days as long as conditions allow. Burning is contingent on weather, fuel moisture, and air quality. All burning is monitored and conducted in accordance with state and county air quality guidelines. And closely coordinated with local county air quality control districts.</p>\n\n<p>Characterized as an understory burn - a prescribed fire ignited under the forest canopy that focuses on the consumption of surface fuels but not the overstory vegetation - prescribed low-intensity fires enhances wildlife habitat, protects and maintains water quality and soil productivity, improves forest ecosystem health, and reduces the threat of uncontrolled conflagrations.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 31 acres can be treated with low-intensity fire, with planned ignition on approximately 10-20 acres daily.  Daily area burnt will vary based on environmental conditions and smoke production.</p>\n\n<p>The Sierra Nevada is a fire dependent ecosystem, where fire is a critical part of the natural forest process and helps to maintain resilient forests, explained Dan Guse, Summit Ranger District Assistant District Fire Management Officer.</p>\n\n<p>Smoke may be visible from Hwy. 108.

The strategy, called “</span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis\"><span>Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A Strategy for Protecting Communities and Improving Resilience in America’s Forests</span></a><span>,” combines a historic investment of congressional funding with years of scientific research and planning into a national effort that will dramatically increase the scale and pace of forest health treatments over the next decade. Through the strategy, the agency will work with states, Tribes and other partners to addresses wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient.</span></p><p><span>In early 2023, the USDA Forest Service added </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/WCS-Second-Landscapes.pdf\"><span>11 additional landscapes</span></a><span>. This announcement followed a year of progress in collaborating with partners across 10 initial landscapes to address wildfire risk to infrastructure and communities. One of these 11 additional landscapes is the Cleveland National Forest. </span></p><p><span>Cleveland National Forest fire crews are starting to conduct fuel treatment operations. These projects will continue through 2023 and into spring 2024. These fuel treatment operations will include vegetation thinning, cutting and piling, mastication, prescribed fire by burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.  Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely in fire prone areas and improve forest health. To view project information for each district please go to projects page: </span><a href=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-publication/cacnf-2024-cleveland-national-forest-fuel-treatments/2024-cnf-projects-01-01-2024\"><span>2024 CNF Projects</span></a></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>The objective of the projects is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape. In fiscal year 2023, the Forest's target for fuels reduction is 6,900 acres. 2,400 acres of planned prescribed fire, and 3,500 acres of mechanical treatments which is a combination of mastication, cut and pile with chainsaws.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully managed and monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.</span><br /><br /><span>Additional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on this page and the forest’s social media on X (formally known as Twitter) at </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/clevelandnf\"><span>https://twitter.com/clevelandnf</span></a><span> and Facebook at </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clevelandnf\"><span>https://www.facebook.com/clevelandnf</span></a></p>",

Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!",

Without fire, hazardous fuels can build up and carry wildfire from the forest floor to tree canopies, creating extreme fire behavior that poses risk to firefighters, surrounding communities and natural resources. Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service’s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.</span></p><p><span>Additional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on on this page and the forest’s social media on Twitter at </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwI5UW5IX9USXnRvgHLegKQ5IHVZ5BKNwyKUtdLE8CwgYIUO2Mt1i3S3fsv-xo_M5hAulYgdcWnheiIBIphhgAopwFJf7zuJmG%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=rOyrj4bdrmvE3sUPGfhsZWBSVmtU207Rc7%2FmHecNanE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://twitter.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span> and Facebook </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwiTwC5K-RFHQry_eaedXPjtasR8A8Aa6p4FFDfOlMyKiVITYWIV93ncx1V9pl4ftl_-oY5zmYTnXu8lWHXNWf6_EN67YKitt0%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0j4mJWsYdg9DxkgTLYi2yHZOZWKjb%2BLdiT69a5P9U%2BU%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://www.facebook.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span>.</span></p>",

Landscapes were chosen based on the potential for wildfire to affect nearby communities, critical infrastructure, public water sources, and Tribal lands. The Forest was positioned well given current efforts around the Nevada Shared Stewardship Agreement, an interagency collaboration effort that has previously identified wildfire crisis landscapes across the state based on similar threats to public and private land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe wildfire crisis landscape projects are a large-scale effort to reduce the risk of wildfire to protect at-risk communities and critical infrastructure, while also increasing the landscape’s resilience and ability to survive the effects of changing climates and other stressors such as insects, disease, and invasive species. Selected wildfire crisis landscapes will advance the goals of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy by utilizing the best available science and strategic network of hazardous fuels and vegetation treatments to reduce wildfire risk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWildfire crisis landscapes, also known as firesheds, are large forested and rangeland areas where communities, infrastructure, and natural resources are at the highest risk to be impacted by wildfire. Examples include critical watersheds and wildlife habitats; utility, energy, and mining facilities; transportation corridors; and recreation areas. Several high-risk fire sheds were identified on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, including the Sierra and Elko Fronts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombined with the initial ten selected landscapes in 2022, the wildfire crisis landscape projects now span nearly 45 million acres across 137 of the 250 high-risk firesheds in the western United States. More than $930 million will be invested in 21 landscapes across 26.7 million acres. This work will mitigate risk to approximately 200 communities within these selected landscapes.",

They were created from 200 acres of thinning as part of the Rio Trampas Project, which aims to restore forest health and resiliency next to communities while providing fuelwood and other wood product opportunities to residents and visitors.</span></p><p><span>The ponderosa forests around the communities are fire-dependent and must undergo fire disturbance on a regular basis to maintain resiliency. Discussions and collaboratives about improving the Embudo Creek Watershed, where these piles are located, have been occurring for years. Most recently, the </span><a href=\"https://www.taoscountywildfire.org/trwc\"><span>Tres Rios Watershed Coalition</span></a><span> was formed to identify priority areas for restoration.</span></p><p><span>The project is part of the national Wildfire Crisis Strategy. As an area with some of the most at-risk firesheds in the nation, the strategy identified a 1.5-million-acre area in and around the Carson National Forest as the Enchanted Circle Landscape. Forest Service staff and partners across the region are working to protect communities and natural resources by restoring healthy, resilient, fire-adapted forests using mechanical thinning and returning beneficial fire in these landscapes.</span></p>",
