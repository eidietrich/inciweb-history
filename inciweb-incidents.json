Pile burning helps eliminate branches, limbs, twigs and small logs that can't easily be removed through other means due to topography, access or cost feasibility. Pile burning typically follows forest thinning projects in overgrown forests. If heavy machinery was used to conduct the thinning, the piles may be much larger than if thinning and piling was completed by hand using chainsaws. </span></p><p><span>Before burning piles, fire managers track hyper-localized weather forecasts to check temperatures, snowpack conditions and wind. Snow and cooler temperatures are key tools in helping contain fire behavior while wind is an important factor in aiding smoke dispersal. Firefighters use air quality monitoring stations in areas where they plan on burning.</span></p><p><span>Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Mild fire behavior between piles is expected and is also beneficial for future wildfire risk reduction. This can include forest litter between piles and lower limbs of trees.  Once burning has begun, firefighters patrol and monitor burned piles until there is no longer any heat emitted. </span></p><p><span>This work is part of the </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001GivvFcc-tevUzDYrb0Gg4UpVPrfqSVl4JAAusVwHGRLqUMVRAXqh62er91EqRMexV5h4aIUoB0Yk5CJIEi6z9lLwq-Ydxeub9V334nOSX2nXnq5BrpHeyR0ofshlyQREJm_TLpC4h3eaGamv4e1tGQvPi1Y0ykgD-tOJyaYFUreY6cGA2KIlUYDeTwnG6NhA%26c%3Dp9KqBFwz5AmuJUEREBmnKB7Uubc2Apvfey7W_5_-v6jwmIxlSQc7xg%3D%3D%26ch%3Dcp3EVjrm9p78Ut1VlhMYW2acMfEeS6DsVCfX1tHbtHhsUi5EMFpE8Q%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cvictoria.ibarra%40usda.gov%7C93a28af96c9c49c0ace308dbe172625f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638351653617355410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WBQ7IgL6IwVgqu%2FkJCbEQK%2BlJFwhO1iMxUXqgxiAgpg%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>National Wildfire Crisis Strategy</strong></span></a><span> effort to reduce the impacts of unplanned, large-scale fires on watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and communities.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Bureau of Land Management Southwest District plans to conduct several prescribed burns beginning early October or as conditions allow. The prescribed burn projects will be on the Gunnison, Tres Rios and Uncompahgre Field Offices. The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  <br /><br />\nWhile no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. <br /><br />\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>.<br />\n </p>\n\n<p>Specific information on upcoming prescribed burn projects can be found in the News section.</p>",

(October 20,2022) – Fire personnel with the Stanislaus National Forest’s Mi-Wok/Summit Ranger District will conduct prescribed burn operations in the Stanislaus Experimental Forest approximately two miles southeast of the Pinecrest area.</p>\n\n<p>Ignition of the prescribed burn is expected to begin the last week of October and will continue for two to three days as long as conditions allow. Burning is contingent on weather, fuel moisture, and air quality. All burning is monitored and conducted in accordance with state and county air quality guidelines. And closely coordinated with local county air quality control districts.</p>\n\n<p>Characterized as an understory burn - a prescribed fire ignited under the forest canopy that focuses on the consumption of surface fuels but not the overstory vegetation - prescribed low-intensity fires enhances wildlife habitat, protects and maintains water quality and soil productivity, improves forest ecosystem health, and reduces the threat of uncontrolled conflagrations.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 31 acres can be treated with low-intensity fire, with planned ignition on approximately 10-20 acres daily.  Daily area burnt will vary based on environmental conditions and smoke production.</p>\n\n<p>The Sierra Nevada is a fire dependent ecosystem, where fire is a critical part of the natural forest process and helps to maintain resilient forests, explained Dan Guse, Summit Ranger District Assistant District Fire Management Officer.</p>\n\n<p>Smoke may be visible from Hwy. 108. Fire managers are working closely with local air districts and the California Air Resources Board to Mitigate the effects of smoke on the public.</p>\n\n<p>Please do not report as a wildland fire.</p>",

Without fire, hazardous fuels can build up and carry wildfire from the forest floor to tree canopies, creating extreme fire behavior that poses risk to firefighters, surrounding communities and natural resources. Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service’s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p><strong>Tuesday 24th, Morning update</strong>:<span> The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective for the incident is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. Firefighters are consolidating unburned fuels and felling hazard trees as the Rabbit Fire incident completes the active fire portion of the project. Emphasis has switched to mainly cleaning up control lines and beginning mop-up operations. At the outset, the plan for this fire was to eliminate excess fuel loading on a portion of forest that had not had a fire in nearly 100 years. That plan has come successfully to its expected conclusion, and as soon as safely possible, the forest will be returned to full visitation. Drivers are advised that Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway will require care and awareness as firefighters are using these areas as gathering points to conduct operations. Crews remain alert and extinguish smoldering material in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed Firefighters are focusing on safeguarding the fire's perimeter while clean-up of the forest floor continues. Hazard tree crews will work with traffic controllers to safely limit delays while cutting to reduce impacts to forest visitors. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of activities until the incident is closed.

Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today.  </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Monday 23rd, Morning update: </strong><span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective for the incident is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. The Rabbit Fire incident is winding down from a very successful day of ignitions and firing on Saturday. The team expertly used the weather, fuel conditions, and fire personnel to accomplish all the day’s objectives. Those activities tied in control lines and effectively put the incident into clean-up mode. Firefighters are now consolidating and burning piles of excess fuel, felling additional hazard trees, cleaning up control lines, and beginning mop-up operations. Crews will continue verifying and extinguishing smoke (smoldering material) in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed. Firefighters will focus on continuing line maintenance and clean-up of the forest floor. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. Falling crews will attempt to keep delays as short as safely possible to limit inconvenience to forest visitors. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of any activities until the incident is closed, and potential smoke impacts to local communities should ease daily going forward<strong>. </strong>Visitors are advised that smoke will continue for several days, possibly weeks. They are NOT reportable occurrences.</span></p><p><strong>Sunday 22nd, Morning update:</strong> <span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. Active fire from firing and ignition operations performed yesterday continues to burn today in the interior. Fire behavior has increased slightly in intensity with the weather. The fire will continue to slowly creep and back into the interior fuel pockets with occasional single tree torching. Fire crews have accomplished incident ignition objectives and are working on additional tree falling, fire line fortification, and monitoring over the next week. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway can be expected for firefighter and public safety. Crews are busy closing off lines around yesterday’s firing operations and overseeing fire growth to planned specific areas. Firefighting crews’ emphasis is now mainly on line maintenance activities. Patrols are monitoring all fire lines and interior fuel pockets within the fire burn area. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones assist with mapping and monitoring fire on tough/dangerous terrain. Today’s operations will be closely monitored by the assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality and potential smoke impacts on local communities. Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today. Ignitions have stopped on the Big Stump prescribed fire until more favorable conditions for ventilations occur, likely this coming weekend.</span></p>",

Landscapes were chosen based on the potential for wildfire to affect nearby communities, critical infrastructure, public water sources, and Tribal lands. The Forest was positioned well given current efforts around the Nevada Shared Stewardship Agreement, an interagency collaboration effort that has previously identified wildfire crisis landscapes across the state based on similar threats to public and private land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe wildfire crisis landscape projects are a large-scale effort to reduce the risk of wildfire to protect at-risk communities and critical infrastructure, while also increasing the landscape’s resilience and ability to survive the effects of changing climates and other stressors such as insects, disease, and invasive species. Selected wildfire crisis landscapes will advance the goals of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy by utilizing the best available science and strategic network of hazardous fuels and vegetation treatments to reduce wildfire risk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWildfire crisis landscapes, also known as firesheds, are large forested and rangeland areas where communities, infrastructure, and natural resources are at the highest risk to be impacted by wildfire. Examples include critical watersheds and wildlife habitats; utility, energy, and mining facilities; transportation corridors; and recreation areas. Several high-risk fire sheds were identified on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, including the Sierra and Elko Fronts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombined with the initial ten selected landscapes in 2022, the wildfire crisis landscape projects now span nearly 45 million acres across 137 of the 250 high-risk firesheds in the western United States. More than $930 million will be invested in 21 landscapes across 26.7 million acres. This work will mitigate risk to approximately 200 communities within these selected landscapes.",
