Pile burning helps eliminate branches, limbs, twigs and small logs that can't easily be removed through other means due to topography, access or cost feasibility. Pile burning typically follows forest thinning projects in overgrown forests. If heavy machinery was used to conduct the thinning, the piles may be much larger than if thinning and piling was completed by hand using chainsaws. </span></p><p><span>Before burning piles, fire managers track hyper-localized weather forecasts to check temperatures, snowpack conditions and wind. Snow and cooler temperatures are key tools in helping contain fire behavior while wind is an important factor in aiding smoke dispersal. Firefighters use air quality monitoring stations in areas where they plan on burning.</span></p><p><span>Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Mild fire behavior between piles is expected and is also beneficial for future wildfire risk reduction. This can include forest litter between piles and lower limbs of trees.  Once burning has begun, firefighters patrol and monitor burned piles until there is no longer any heat emitted. </span></p><p><span>This work is part of the </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001GivvFcc-tevUzDYrb0Gg4UpVPrfqSVl4JAAusVwHGRLqUMVRAXqh62er91EqRMexV5h4aIUoB0Yk5CJIEi6z9lLwq-Ydxeub9V334nOSX2nXnq5BrpHeyR0ofshlyQREJm_TLpC4h3eaGamv4e1tGQvPi1Y0ykgD-tOJyaYFUreY6cGA2KIlUYDeTwnG6NhA%26c%3Dp9KqBFwz5AmuJUEREBmnKB7Uubc2Apvfey7W_5_-v6jwmIxlSQc7xg%3D%3D%26ch%3Dcp3EVjrm9p78Ut1VlhMYW2acMfEeS6DsVCfX1tHbtHhsUi5EMFpE8Q%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cvictoria.ibarra%40usda.gov%7C93a28af96c9c49c0ace308dbe172625f%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C1%7C0%7C638351653617355410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WBQ7IgL6IwVgqu%2FkJCbEQK%2BlJFwhO1iMxUXqgxiAgpg%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>National Wildfire Crisis Strategy</strong></span></a><span> effort to reduce the impacts of unplanned, large-scale fires on watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and communities.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p>The Bureau of Land Management Southwest District plans to conduct several prescribed burns beginning early October or as conditions allow. The prescribed burn projects will be on the Gunnison, Tres Rios and Uncompahgre Field Offices. The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  <br /><br />\nWhile no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. <br /><br />\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>.<br />\n </p>\n\n<p>Specific information on upcoming prescribed burn projects can be found in the News section.</p>",

The pile burn area is located near the Red Canyon Recreation Site approximately 6 miles northwest of the town of Mountainair in the southern half of the Manzano Mountains, in Torrance County New Mexico. <strong>See map attached</strong>. Smoke may be visible in the surrounding areas of Mountainair, Punta de Agua, Manzano, or the Estancia Valley.</span></p><p><span>Ignition start will depend upon agency administrator approval and conditions within the ranges outlined in burn plan. Optimal conditions will result in effective smoke ventilation and dispersal and help achieve the desired effects needed to accomplish the burn plan objectives. Pending suitable conditions, winter is an optimal time to burn piled slash and woody debris from earlier forest restoration work since snow on the ground keeps fire from spreading to adjacent vegetation.</span></p><p><span>Prescribed fires are utilized to remove hazardous fuels, return nutrients to the soil and improve forest health. Fuels specialists write prescribed burn plans that identify – or prescribe – the best conditions under which trees and other plants will burn to safely optimize results. Burn plans consider temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation and optimal conditions for smoke dispersal.</span></p><p><span>Generally, pile burns produce less smoke and burn with less intensity than broadcast burns across a larger landscape. Fire personnel will monitor the burn perimeter until it is completely out. Smoke may be visible periodically from local communities for the duration of the project until the burning vegetation is out. However, firefighters take measures to reduce smoke impacts as much as possible. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the </span><a href=\"http://www.airnow.gov/\"><span>www.airnow.gov/</span></a></p><p><span>Our land management strategy is centered on long-term forest health which includes reducing forest fuels and using prescribed fire on the landscape. A healthy forest is a resilient forest that undergoes fire occurrences on a regular basis. After prescribed fire is completed, if a future wildfire reaches this area, the fire behavior will likely be modified to a less intense, more manageable surface fire due to the absence of accumulated debris and ladder fuels.</span></p><p><span>Implementation announcements and updates on prescribed fire projects will be posted on </span><a href=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/\"><span>InciWeb</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://nmfireinfo.com/\"><span>New Mexico Fire Information</span></a><span> and on the </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/cibola\"><span>Cibola NF &amp; NGs website</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cibolanf/\"><span>Cibola Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cibola_nf\"><span>Cibola Twitter</span></a><span> sites.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Mountainair District Office: 505-847-2990</span><br /><span>Cibola National Forest and National Grasslands Supervisor’s Office: 505-346-3900</span></p>",

Under the umbrella of an Incident Management Organization (IMO), teams of drivers are systematically driving forest roads and assessing damage to roads, recreation sites, or OHV trails. Once located, the sites are turned over to other staff within the IMO equipped with chainsaws and shovels for fallen tree removal or to staff with back-hoe tractors, tracked excavators, and dump trucks. These equipment operators are smoothing out roads, filling erosion holes, cleaning debris from culverts, and generally doing what they can to fix the roads in a timely manner. Damaged sections that require a more substantial repair will be contracted through the Forest Engineer for more specialized contractors to completion.  Larger equipment has been requested to assist with road repairs.  </p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><strong>Winter Road Closures</strong> </span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>A forest closure order remains in effect through June 15th for the Western Divide and Kern River Ranger Districts of the Sequoia National Forest.  Full details available on the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1082404.pdf\">Sequoia National Forest Website.</a> These closures are designed to help protect road surfaces and natural resources.

The spring had been cool, limiting the snowmelt. However, weather forecast for early July has very warm temperatures for the area. This means there's a lot of snow out there to melt and could cause potential flooding and swift, cold water flows.</span></p><p><span>California’s historic snowpack is now starting to melt with warming springtime temperatures, causing the levels of creeks, streams, and rivers to rise significantly and flood some areas. According to the National Weather Service, the bulk of the flooding may happen in late May to early August, however it will continue to persist into fall because of the depth and density of the snowpack.</span></p><p><span><strong>INYO NATIONAL FOREST SNOWMELT FLOOD INFORMATION</strong></span></p><p><span>Inyo National Forest welcomes visitors to enjoy this unusually lush and beautiful spring and summer, but please proceed with caution. Not every trail or road has been surveyed and deemed “safe” to recreate on, so it is up to you to look out for your own safety and plan for any unexpected changes to your trip.</span></p><p><span>There is a heightened risk of flooding, landslides, debris flows, road/trail washouts and avalanches. And with the combination of extended hot weather and abundant snow means certain areas may remain above flood stage for some time.</span></p><p><span>Creeks and streams will be at higher flows for longer into the year, making them challenging or impossible to cross. Steep snowbanks on either side of streams and creeks may add additional challenges to crossing.</span></p><p><span><strong>Campgrounds:</strong></span></p><p><span>In addition to the prolonged presence of snow, downed trees, log jams, and rock falls are delaying the openings of many of the Forest’s campground facilities. Forest recreation staff are working with the concessionaires to clear these obstacles and get the campgrounds open as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span>Want to know the status of a campground? Please visit the Inyo National Forest’s </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recmain/inyo/recreation\"><span>RECREATION</span></a><span> page.</span></p><p><span><strong>Trails:</strong></span></p><p><span>The trails may also be heavily eroded, have mudslides, rockfalls, and/or downed trees and the work to repair them will be delayed as the Forest works hard with its partner organizations to triage and repair the most dangerous areas of trail that need it.</span></p><p><span>Keep in mind, Forest hiking trails are still covered in snow, and accessing some trailheads will be delayed or impossible as the snow continues to melt.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, there are still dangers of avalanches happening. Be sure to check on the Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center website on conditions before you go: </span><a href=\"http://www.esavalanche.org/\"><span>www.esavalanche.org</span></a></p><p><span>While hiking, it will be wet and muddy and may have sections of flowing or standing water on them. With that, the Forest does expect the mosquitoes to be out this year with force.</span></p><p><span><strong>HOW YOU CAN PREPARE</strong></span></p><p><span>As temperatures continue to rise, and the snow continues to melt, the National Weather Service (NWS) could issue flood advisories for the local forest area. Certain areas could come under flood warnings or watches, and the Forest will not be closing those areas because of that.</span></p><p><span>It is up to you to keep up on the flood advisories and make your plans accordingly.

This change to a smaller organization was possible due to the successful suppression efforts; additional containment; and decreased fire behavior and intensity. </span></p><p>The Spring Creek Fire started on Saturday, June 24. Firefighters and aircraft worked to keep the fire to about 200 acres on a mix of private and Bureau of Land Management-administered land. Hot, dry, windy conditions aligned with terrain on June 26, causing the fire to make a significant run growing to more than 2,500 acres. Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team Two assumed command of the fire June 28. </p><p><span>The varied fuels and extreme terrain presented substantial challenges to firefighters during containment efforts. Crews used a variety of tactics including direct handline against the black fire’s edge and indirect tactics where terrain would not allow firefighters to safely engage.</span></p><p><span>Firefighters are now mopping up hotspots, providing suppression repair to disturbed firelines and patrolling firelines. Personnel are removing equipment no longer needed on the fireline.

The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!",

After 12 hours of fire activity, the Lowline Fire was at 400 acres. Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the fire on July 28th at 7 a.m. On August 9th, management of the fire was transitioned to a Type 3 Team as fire behavior slowed and as the confine and contain management strategy for the fire reached 55% containment.

Smoke continues to be visible from County Road 730 and Ohio Creek and will likely persist until the area receives a season-ending weather event. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The Lowline Fire is a long-duration wildfire event that is currently being administered under a “confine and contain” management strategy. Using this strategy, firefighters concentrate their fire suppression and containment efforts around the values at risk to the north, east and south of the Lowline Fire. On the western edge of this fire, the goal is to confine fire growth toward the wilderness boundary, where fire can be helpfully utilized toward forest health and future fire suppression needs. This management strategy is also a safer and more effective use of firefighting personnel, as the western area of the Lowline Fire presents a significant safety risk to firefighters due to heavy amounts of dead and downed trees. Firefighter and public safety remain our priorities. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>All evacuation notices have been lifted for the Lowline Fire.

It is located approximately 12 miles west, southwest of Delta, CO within the Dominguez Escalante National Conservation Area.</span></p><p><span>This fire is being managed with a confine and contain suppression strategy that provides for firefighter and public safety. Confine and contain strategy mean's that firefighters will work to keep fire to certain areas, primarily using natural barriers that are expected to restrict fire spread under prevailing and forecasted weather conditions. Natural barriers can be large areas of rock, dirt, sand, water sources, existing roads, and trails. Indirect line construction by hand line, mechanical can be used in the event fire activity increases and threatens values at risk. Check out this YouTube video that explains how confine &amp; contain strategy was determined and used </span><a href=\"//youtu.be/QfTz-5SCcmk?si=1dxYurMNz_IfHaat\"><span> https://youtu.be/QfTz-5SCcmk?si=1dxYurMNz_IfHaat</span></a><span> Video can also be found at the bottom of page in related links. </span></p><p>A Type 3 organization assumed command of the fire on August 9, 2023, at 6 a.m.</p><p>A Type 4 Incident Commander assumed management responsibility on Friday, August 18, 2023, at 7 a.m.</p><p><span>The Little Mesa Fire reached 100% containment on Tuesday, September 19, 2023. </span></p><p><span>The smoke will be visible from surrounding areas and Highways 50, 550, 92, 65 and 141 as the interior continues to smolder.

Fire aviation resources are flying at different altitudes and speeds. Pilots should exercise caution when flying near wildfires to keep everyone safe. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones must never fly near wildfires, as UAS are difficult to see and drone pilots have no way of communicating with firefighting aircraft. The only UAS or drones able to fly are agency owned and operated and have been assigned to work on the wildfire and have communication with air operations. <strong>Remember if you fly, we can’t!</strong></span></p>",

If conditions are appropriate, about 7,000 acres with the potential of up to 15,000 acres are planned to be burned over multiple days, reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfire and improving wildlife habitat. The project area includes Cow Creek, Calamity Creek, and Indian Creek. The Cow Creek Prescribed Burn is being accomplished using joint-agency fire resources, utilizing both aerial and hand ignitions, and is being closely monitored to ensure that the burn area remains within the designated boundaries. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prescribed burning is a tool that re-introduces fire into the ecosystem to promote and regenerate healthy trees and habitat conditions. This type of fire management strategy is important to maintain a fire-adapted ecosystem and is essential for wildfire prevention. Before conducting a prescribed burn, extensive planning takes place to establish proper parameters such as weather, fuel conditions, smoke dispersion, staffing, and other agency coordination. A prescribed fire is a planned fire used to accomplish management objectives. One of the objectives for this burn is to reduce the overgrown and crowded fuels in the area, therefore creating a mosaic landscape that is more resistant to catastrophic wildfire. This prescribed fire is also aiming to enhance productive vegetation in the oak brush and mountain shrub parts of the burn area, in order to increase habitat for wildlife and livestock.  </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Significant coordinating efforts occur with local landowners, protection partners, and other cooperating agencies to ensure the burn is conducted safely. The safety of firefighters and the public are the most important factors considered when planning prescribed fires. For more information on prescription burning and its use, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire\"><span>https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire</span></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dispersed recreation in the prescribed fire project areas may be impacted.

Smoke from the prescribed fire is being managed to have minimal impact on neighboring communities.

It is currently burning at Hoppe Point located northwest of the McPhee Dam and Reservoir, east of Bradfield Campground.</span><span> </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The location of the fire is within the boundaries of a prescribed fire burn unit and fire personnel have been working to prepare lines around the area. Firefighters are reinforcing and using previously defined and prepared control lines to allow this naturally caused wildfire to reduce forest fuels and improve forest health within those boundaries. This will decrease risk of future catastrophic wildfire, protect infrastructure and private lands, and improve forage for wildlife.</span><span> </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The intended result of this suppression strategy is to allow a naturally caused wildfire to reduce hazardous fuels, encourage the growth of native plants, promote ponderosa pine regeneration, increase species diversity in the understory, restore ecological resiliency and reduce the potential for future high-severity wildfires. These efforts align with the Forest Service's 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy, which aims to increase the use of fire on the landscape as well as other treatments to improve forest resiliency. </span><span> </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </span><span> </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Current</strong> </span><span> </span></p><ul><li><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Recent weather aided firefighters in preventing further fire growth and containment has increased to 70%.</span><span> </span></li><li><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, firefighters will work to improve the containment lines along the Forest Service 510 road and continue extinguishing heat in isolated pockets.</span><span> </span></li></ul><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Outlook</strong>  </span><span> </span></p><ul><li><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Firefighters will begin to transition to rehab activities, checking fence lines, repairing roads, and applying native seed to prevent erosion concerns.  </span><span> </span></li></ul>",

Without fire, hazardous fuels can build up and carry wildfire from the forest floor to tree canopies, creating extreme fire behavior that poses risk to firefighters, surrounding communities and natural resources. Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service’s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.</span></p><p><span>Additional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on on this page and the forest’s social media on Twitter at </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwI5UW5IX9USXnRvgHLegKQ5IHVZ5BKNwyKUtdLE8CwgYIUO2Mt1i3S3fsv-xo_M5hAulYgdcWnheiIBIphhgAopwFJf7zuJmG%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=rOyrj4bdrmvE3sUPGfhsZWBSVmtU207Rc7%2FmHecNanE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://twitter.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span> and Facebook </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwiTwC5K-RFHQry_eaedXPjtasR8A8Aa6p4FFDfOlMyKiVITYWIV93ncx1V9pl4ftl_-oY5zmYTnXu8lWHXNWf6_EN67YKitt0%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0j4mJWsYdg9DxkgTLYi2yHZOZWKjb%2BLdiT69a5P9U%2BU%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://www.facebook.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span>.</span></p>",

The Rabbit Fire has grown to approximately 28 acres. It continues burning with a low fire intensity as it creeps through and consumes the dead and downed trees and brush that cover the ground’s surface around the fire’s perimeter. Fire managers continue to evaluate the Rabbit Wildfire to determine the initial and long-term risks associated with the wildfire. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis process considers of the firefighters and public safety, natural and cultural resources, and values to be protected. This revolving evaluation ensures fire managers apply a risk management process that minimizes unnecessary risk in wildfire response while maximizing the opportunities to achieve agency management objectives by providing for safety first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA significant role of the Forest Service is to manage natural resources on public lands, and the Rabbit Fire response decision includes objectives that include improving and enhancing natural resources while managing naturally occurring wildfires. To achieve that objective, Land and Resource Management Plans identify that fire plays a role in managing natural systems which is a primary mission<br />\r\n",

Firefighters are consolidating unburned fuels and felling hazard trees as the Rabbit Fire incident completes the active fire portion of the project. Emphasis has switched to mainly cleaning up control lines and beginning mop-up operations. At the outset, the plan for this fire was to eliminate excess fuel loading on a portion of forest that had not had a fire in nearly 100 years. That plan has come successfully to its expected conclusion, and as soon as safely possible, the forest will be returned to full visitation. Drivers are advised that Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway will require care and awareness as firefighters are using these areas as gathering points to conduct operations. Crews remain alert and extinguish smoldering material in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed Firefighters are focusing on safeguarding the fire's perimeter while clean-up of the forest floor continues. Hazard tree crews will work with traffic controllers to safely limit delays while cutting to reduce impacts to forest visitors. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of activities until the incident is closed. Visitors and travelers should be aware that smoke is expected to continue for several days. Potential smoke impacts on local communities should ease daily. Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today.  </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Monday 23rd, Morning update: </strong><span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective for the incident is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. The Rabbit Fire incident is winding down from a very successful day of ignitions and firing on Saturday. The team expertly used the weather, fuel conditions, and fire personnel to accomplish all the day’s objectives. Those activities tied in control lines and effectively put the incident into clean-up mode. Firefighters are now consolidating and burning piles of excess fuel, felling additional hazard trees, cleaning up control lines, and beginning mop-up operations. Crews will continue verifying and extinguishing smoke (smoldering material) in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed. Firefighters will focus on continuing line maintenance and clean-up of the forest floor. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. Falling crews will attempt to keep delays as short as safely possible to limit inconvenience to forest visitors. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of any activities until the incident is closed, and potential smoke impacts to local communities should ease daily going forward<strong>. </strong>Visitors are advised that smoke will continue for several days, possibly weeks. They are NOT reportable occurrences.</span></p><p><strong>Sunday 22nd, Morning update:</strong> <span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. Active fire from firing and ignition operations performed yesterday continues to burn today in the interior. Fire behavior has increased slightly in intensity with the weather. The fire will continue to slowly creep and back into the interior fuel pockets with occasional single tree torching. Fire crews have accomplished incident ignition objectives and are working on additional tree falling, fire line fortification, and monitoring over the next week. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway can be expected for firefighter and public safety. Crews are busy closing off lines around yesterday’s firing operations and overseeing fire growth to planned specific areas. Firefighting crews’ emphasis is now mainly on line maintenance activities. Patrols are monitoring all fire lines and interior fuel pockets within the fire burn area. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones assist with mapping and monitoring fire on tough/dangerous terrain. Today’s operations will be closely monitored by the assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality and potential smoke impacts on local communities. Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today. Ignitions have stopped on the Big Stump prescribed fire until more favorable conditions for ventilations occur, likely this coming weekend.</span></p>",

Fire managers are monitoring forecasts and ground conditions before ignitions. Once burned, crews will patrol and monitor the piles until they are called out.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The piles were created as are part of the Green Fuelwood Areas Project, which aims to restore forest health and resiliency next to communities while providing fuelwood and other wood product opportunities to residents.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The ponderosa forests around Ojo Sarco are fire-dependent and must undergo fire disturbance on a regular basis to maintain resiliency. After prescribed fires are completed, if a future wildfire reaches an area, the fire behavior will likely be modified to a less intense, more manageable surface fire making it safer for firefighters to engage.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">(Photo: Ojo Sarco piles in March 2023)</span></p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">For the Record: An earlier version of this overview mistakenly called the project the Rio Trampas Project. It is the Green Fuelwood Areas Project.</span></em></p>",
