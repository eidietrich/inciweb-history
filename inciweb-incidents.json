Prescribed fire is a proactive tool for several purposes, including reducing hazardous fuels, which decreases the threat of high-intensity, high-severity wildfires.<br /><br />\nIt also reduces the risk of insect and disease outbreaks, recycles nutrients that increase soil productivity, and improves wildlife habitat. The actual days of ignition for prescribed burning will depend on several factors, including appropriate humidity levels, wind speed and direction, temperature, and fuel moisture. Burns only occur on days when weather conditions exist for good smoke dispersal.</p>\n\n<p>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Smoke may be visible, but these fires are all carefully monitored, and local fire departments are aware of prescribed fire activity.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p>On May 8, 2023, conditions were good for ignitions to start on the Animas City Mountain. The project took the whole week to make sure the prescribed fire was an success. Ignitions were completed on Friday, May 12th, for a total of 495 acres treated. Firefighters patrolled and secured the edges for weeks after until moisture came into the area. Check out this YouTube video about the project <a href=\"https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv\">https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the risk of high-intensity wildfire, improve forest health and wildlife habitat, the Bureau of Land Management Tres Rios Field Office has planned a prescribed fire treatment for up to 652 acres on Animas City Mountain in Durango, Colorado. Dependent on weather and the availability of firefighters to conduct the operation, the prescribed burns could take place in spring and fall months. An Environmental Assessment which covers this, as well as other treatment areas in La Plata County, has been completed and is available here: <a href=\"https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1505044/510\">Final Environmental Assessment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires require a comprehensive plan consisting of 21 elements. The plan outlines the methodical process from inception to completion. The Animas City Mountain project is expected to take 2-3 days for ignitions, with additional time to patrol the area and extinguish hot spots. The mountain has been divided into seven units or compartments. Crews are expected to begin burning on the top of the mountain by slowly lighting an edge that has already been thinned with chainsaws. Once a secure edge or “black line” has been established, firefighters ignite the interior of each unit, one unit at a time. The fire then burns back toward the secured, black edge. This methodical approach allows firefighters opportunities to halt ignitions if burning conditions become undesirable. Examples of undesirable conditions are fire behavior that is too active/not active enough, and poor smoke dispersion. Firefighters will also have water on hand to cool things down if fire activity grows beyond a desirable level.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires are watched carefully by firefighters around the burn, lookouts at more distant locations, aerially (helicopters, planes, drones), and with calibrated smoke monitors. These monitors will be placed at locations around the burn to track smoke impacts in real time. The BLM and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Air Quality (CPDHE) have been working since 2018 to develop a permit that accomplishes the burn while minimizing smoke impacts to the surrounding area. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>. Prescribed fires are a tool to minimize smoke impacts to communities by careful selection of when fires burn and when they stop. Firefighters utilize compartments to halt the fire from spreading overnight, whereas wildfire continue to burn overnight when smoke is likely to settle into low lying areas where communities are located. Residual smoke from the interior areas of the compartments is anticipated, but the goal is to start early in the day and stop early in the evening to give material as much time as possible to be consumed before night-time cooling occurs and smoke sinks into the valley.</p>\n\n<p>Ideal timing (windows) for the project occurs during the Spring and Fall when conditions are more favorable for low-intensity fire. Fuel (vegetation) and weather conditions must fall within a predetermined “prescription” that is known to yield desirable results while still being controllable by the fire personnel conducting the burn. Dissipation of smoke is also part of the prescription. Prescription development has been done by local fire experts who utilize fire behavior computer modeling software combined with decades of experience conducting prescribed burn in southwest Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>This project is a coordinated effort between the federal/county/local government, NGOs, emergency managers, fire departments, public health officials, state smoke regulators and nearby residents. The burn is planned to take place over the course of 2-3 days. Brief closure of Animas City Mountain during the ignitions will occur for public and firefighter safety. The containment lines used for the project will consist of BLM designated trails. The units will be ignited using a combination of ground and aerial resources and will be patrolled/mopped up until out.</p>\n\n<p>The project is part of the BLM’s ongoing commitment to protecting human health and safety while maintaining or enhancing forest and woodland health and functionality. The Animas City Mountain area was previously masticated in 2010 which altered the vertical structure of the forest stand to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Mastication is a treatment method where the understory is mowed and mulched with a large machine. The mulched material slowly decomposes, while the understory regrows. Mastication and prescribed fire are effective in preventing fires from leaving the ground and becoming “crown” fires where the entire trees or stand of trees burn. Treatments thin and remove some of the large dense understory or “ladder fuels”.</p>\n\n<p>Vegetation, however, grows back and requires maintenance. Prescribed fire is the best treatment option for this forest type, if possible, after the initial mechanical treatment. While consuming some of the standing vegetation; prescribed fire also eliminates material left on the ground from both mastication and the natural shedding of leaves, needles, etc. Fire is the only natural process used as a treatment method and produces the most effective results for hazardous fuel reduction while enhancing woodland health. Ponderosa pine woodlands are a drought resistant species that have evolved with a natural cycle of frequent, low-intensity fire.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fire mimics this natural process and improves forage for wildlife, as well as increasing plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where grasses and flowers can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Every year the west is impacted by large catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and other treatment methods lessen the impacts of future fires and increase the likelihood firefighters can work safely and be effective at stopping fires in and near treated areas.</p>\n\n<p> </p>",

Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. <br /><br />\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented.

These fuel treatment operations will include prescribed fire, vegetation cutting, removal, and burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.  Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce unnatural vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely with fire.</p>\n\n<p>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</p>\n\n<p>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.<br /><br />\nAdditional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on this page and the forest’s social media on Twitter at <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwI5UW5IX9USXnRvgHLegKQ5IHVZ5BKNwyKUtdLE8CwgYIUO2Mt1i3S3fsv-xo_M5hAulYgdcWnheiIBIphhgAopwFJf7zuJmG%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=rOyrj4bdrmvE3sUPGfhsZWBSVmtU207Rc7%2FmHecNanE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><strong>https://twitter.com/SanBernardinoNF</strong></a> and Facebook <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwiTwC5K-RFHQry_eaedXPjtasR8A8Aa6p4FFDfOlMyKiVITYWIV93ncx1V9pl4ftl_-oY5zmYTnXu8lWHXNWf6_EN67YKitt0%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0j4mJWsYdg9DxkgTLYi2yHZOZWKjb%2BLdiT69a5P9U%2BU%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/SanBernardinoNF</strong></a></p>",

The spring had been cool, limiting the snowmelt. However, weather forecast for early July has very warm temperatures for the area. This means there's a lot of snow out there to melt and could cause potential flooding and swift, cold water flows.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>California’s historic snowpack is now starting to melt with</span></span></span><span> warming springtime temperatures, causing the levels of creeks, streams, and river</span><span>s to rise significantly and flood some areas. <span><span>According to the National Weather Service, the bulk of the flooding may happen in late May to early August, however it will continue to persist into fall because of the depth and density of the snowpack.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong><span>INYO NATIONAL FOREST SNOWMELT FLOOD INFORMATION</span></strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Inyo National Forest welcomes visitors to enjoy this unusually lush and beautiful spring and summer, but please proceed with caution. Not every trail or road has been surveyed and deemed “safe” to recreate on, so it is up to you to look out for your own safety and plan for any unexpected changes to your trip.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>There is a heightened risk of flooding, landslides, debris flows, road/trail washouts and avalanches.<span><span> And with the combination of extended hot weather and abundant snow means certain areas may remain above flood stage for some time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Creeks and streams will be at higher flows for longer into the year, making them challenging or impossible to cross. Steep snowbanks on either side of streams and creeks may add additional challenges to crossing.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong><span>Campgrounds:</span></strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to the prolonged presence of snow, downed trees, log jams, and rock falls are delaying the openings of many of the Forest’s campground facilities. Forest recreation staff are working with the concessionaires to clear these obstacles and get the campgrounds open as soon as possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>Want to know the status of a campground?

The fire burned through grass and brush just northwest of the McDowell Mountains. Multiple homes were impacted and immediately threatened forcing the evacuation of 100+ homes and 1,145 residents. The wind-driven fire moved quickly throughout Tuesday afternoon and evening. Aircraft including Large Air Tankers, Very Large Air Tankers, a Lead Plane and Air Attack worked to help slow the fire's movement. Eight loads of retardant were utilized in Tuesday's suppression efforts. 150 personnel remain assigned to the incident, including one USFS Hotshot Crew, three AZ Department of Forestry and Fire Management Type 2 hand crews, 10 engines and two water tenders.

This page also highlights the ongoing storm recovery effort of an established USDA Forest Service Incident Management Organization (IMO) that was implemented January 17 to safely and systematically open storm-damaged areas of the forest for public and emergency responder access. </p>\n\n<p>More information on the 2023 Los Padres National Forest Emergency Flood Recovery can be found at the following websites:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/lpnf\">Los Padres National Forest website</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfsregion5/albums/72177720309579324\">Los Padres Storm Damage and Storm Recovery Flickr Album</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lospadresnationalforest\">Los Padres National Forest Facebook Page</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LosPadresNF\">Los Padres National Forest Twitter Page</a></p>\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2><strong>INCIDENT BACKGROUND</strong></h2>\n\n<p>A series of winter storms brought heavy rainfall to California and impacted many areas of the Los Padres National Forest as a series of 12 atmospheric rivers hit the west coast from December 2022 through March 2023 (<a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/2023/01/11/atmospheric-rivers-what-are-they-and-how-does-noaa-study-them/\">NOAA atmospheric river</a>). This consistent barrage of rainfall created debris flows that washed out forest roads, buried recreation areas, and left some residences stranded without ingress/egress to their homes.</p>\n\n<p>After the initial powerful storm in January that caused flooding, Los Padres National Forest employees immediately began assessing the damage, and on January 17 an emergency flood response IMO was established. The initial focus was to help residents regain access to their homes. Afterwards, the objectives shifted to safely reopening areas for public and emergency responder personnel, including firefighting vehicles for initial attack and extended attack operations throughout the forest.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>INCIDENT OBJECTIVES</h2>\n\n<ol><li>\n\t<p>Provide for public safety by identifying and mitigating road, trail, and recreational infrastructure damage. Reopen sections of the Forest that are safe for public use.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for safety of agency personnel by identifying and mitigating hazards to administrative sites and ensuring travel routes are safe.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for emergency response preparedness by identifying and mitigating damage to critical infrastructure such as communication towers.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for rapid damage assessment on infrastructure (roads, trails, bridges, buildings, developed recreation sites, etc.) forest wide.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide for access to private property, residences and businesses that are located within Forest boundaries.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Coordinate with the Regional Storm Damage Response team as requested. - Actively communicate with the public and elected officials about status of storm damage and mitigation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Coordinate with partners, agencies, and volunteers in storm damage assessment and mitigation activities.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol><h2> </h2>\n\n<h2>CURRENT IMO OPERATIONS</h2>\n\n<p>The Incident Management Organization (IMO) will continue to assess roads, trails and recreation areas. USDA Forest Service equipment operators and contractors will use equipment to repair roads and culverts. Firefighting crews will focus on opening trails while maintaining initial attack readiness in the event of any new wildfire starts.</p>\n\n<p>Resource advisors (READs) will determine potential impacts to plant, animal, cultural, archaeology, engineering, recreation, hydrology and other forest resources prior to beginning work. Assessments, heavy equipment work, and handcrew work is ongoing on the Monterey, Santa Lucia, Santa Barbara, Mt. Pinos and Ojai ranger districts. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>CLOSURE INFORMATION BY DISTRICT </strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Los Padres National Forest strongly encourages the public to adhere to closure signs as hazardous conditions are still present on these roads, making travel unsafe and potentially impossible. Violators who become stranded in closed areas and require assistance create unnecessary risk for search and rescue teams and may face legal consequences. </p>\n\n<p>Forest visitors should also be aware that heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators and road graders will be working to repair storm-damaged roads. Please allow adequate space when walking or driving around equipment and ensure verbal and visual confirmation is given before passing. </p>\n\n<h2>1.

The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!",

Due to this active fire behavior and resulting growth, these fires have merged and will be referred to as the Bowles Creek Fire.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p>At approximately 8 a.m. Wednesday, July 26, the Lowline Fire was reported on a ridge between Squirrel and Mill Creeks in Gunnison County. By 8 p.m., the fire had reached 400 acres in size. Rocky Mountain CIM1 assumed command of the fire on July 28th at 7 a.m. By this time, the fire was approximately 730 acres. The Lowline was transitioned to a Type 3 IMT on August 9th, after conditions stabilized. At 7 a.m. on August 16, command of the Lowline Fire transitioned back to the Gunnison Ranger District.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>The Lowline Fire was most recently measured at <span><span><span><span><span><span>1899</span></span></span></span></span></span> acres (8/22/23) with 55% of the fire contained. The remaining perimeter of the fire, while not considered an official containment line, has remained cool and is holding along natural features such as creek beds, aspen groves and ridgelines. The firefighting strategy can now transition to a long-term operational plan managed by the Forest. Some fire growth to the west is expected until a season-ending weather event fully extinguishes the fire. Firefighting personnel remain working on the fire and are prepared for quick response should fire conditions change. These firefighters will continue to maintain observational and strategic attack capacity until the Lowline Fire is no longer considered a re-ignition risk for the area. This level of readiness could remain in place for the next several months, depending on future weather and environmental conditions.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>A pre-evacuation order remains in effect for residents along CR 727 along Mill Creek. No other evacuations or pre-evacuations are in place near the fire.

The fire was first spotted burning in heavy timber late afternoon on August 16 and quickly grew to about 100 acres the first evening.  The fire burned actively overnight and by the next day it was estimated to be about 1,690 acres and grew throughout the day. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Firefighting resources responded quickly to suppress by utilizing seven single engine air tankers and four large air tankers who dropped retardant continuously until daylight ended. Scooper planes, retardant planes, and helicopters will continue to be utilized to assist firefighters on the ground.  Crews consisting of about 20 people arrived as soon as they could and continue to arrive from around the country to aid the fight. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>By August 18 the fire was mapped at 2750 acres as crews continued to arrive and construct fireline with an anchor point at East Mountain repeater site. Aircraft and scooper planes flew throughout the day, but the fire spread to the north and east into the Middle Fork drainage.  As of Aug 19, an infrared flight mapped the fire at 4158 acres even as the higher humidities and a little moisture hit the fire in the evening.  </span></span></p>\n\n<p>The Great Basin Incident Management Type 2 Team took command of the fire on August 20 and had a good transition day with local fire managers to continue plans of suppressing the fire and keeping firefighters safe. </p>\n\n<p><span><span>An area closure took effect Aug 18, 2023 at 6:00pm: Order number 0402-04-102 and maps are available in the \"maps\" tab. </span></span></p>\n\n<p>From Saturday afternoon Aug 17, 2023 to Tuesday Aug, 22 the fire area received 2.23\" of rain.  Due to that rain firefighters stayed off of the wet muddy roads as much as possible in order to reduce damage that the vehicles could have caused. </p>\n\n<p>As some warming and drying occurred after the storm, crews re-engaged in suppression activities and mainly focusing on the western and northern edges of the fire perimeter. As of August 30th, the fire is 59% contained and crews have made good progress on containing the northern and western edges of the fire perimeter.  The uncontained portion of the fire is the eastern edge that is located in the Middle Fork Payette River Drainage.  That area is steep, rugged terrain, with limited access.  That area of the fire will continue to be monitored by personnel such as lookout and aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>Transfer of command back to the local district will occur on Wednesday 8/30 at 1800, and the closure area has been reduced.  See closure tab and order #0402-04-103. </p>",

    "field_incident_overview": "<p><em>Update 9/8/23: Activity and smoke impacts are expected to increase vegetation dries, with the most pronounced impacts at night and in the morning in the Middle Fork Drainage (between the Giant Forest/Lodgepole area, the foothills, and the community of Three Rivers). The following trails are closed (see map): The Redwood Meadow-Bearpaw Trail, the Redwood Meadow Cutoff Trail, the Paradise Ridge-Redwood Meadow Trail, and the Cliff Creek Trail (north of the Timber Gap Trail Junction). </em></p>\n\n<p><em>A combination of aerial and hand ignitions is planned to begin on Wednesday, Sep 13, and continue for about 7 days. Fire size is expected to increase to about 1500 acres throughout this time.</em><em> This will allow firefighters to regulate the intensity of the fire as fuels are consumed.  Regulating the intensity of the fire will help to ensure that there are favorable fire effects within the burned area, especially as the fire moves through giant sequoia groves.  </em></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Fire management staff and park leadership have elected to utilize a confine and contain strategy to manage the Redwood Fire, located in the wilderness of Sequoia National Park, near Redwood Meadow. The lightning-ignited fire was last measured at 299 acres in size and burning at low intensity through a densely forested area. It currently poses no threats to life or property.  </p>\n\n<p>The Redwood Fire, discovered on August 15, is one of seven fires ignited by lightning throughout the parks during August, and is the only one of those that has shown any significant growth potential thus far. After the previous very wet winter and recent additional precipitation, moisture in the living vegetation has thus far done an excellent job of moderating fire behavior in the dense forest stand. The fire is burning in an area that lacks recent fire history and has the potential, especially under the current favorable conditions, to be beneficial to the landscape in this area.  </p>\n\n<p>A confine and contain strategy aims to ultimately suppress the fire within a larger footprint, utilizing a combination of natural and manmade barriers. This will allow the parks to limit the duration of smoke impacts, lessen the possibility of major changes or escalations in fire behavior, reduce unnecessary risk, and utilize firefighting resources that are currently available, while still getting the benefits of badly-needed fire in this area of the broader Sierra Nevada landscape.  </p>\n\n<p>Fire managers in the parks have identified a containment area of approximately 3,000 acres, bordered by features including the Cliff Creek Trail, Granite Creek, and large rocky areas to the east.  The containment area also takes advantage of recent understory thinning and piling in the nearby Redwood Meadow Grove of giant sequoias. This work is part of the Sequoia Emergency Action Project, which aims to reduce the risk of future widespread high-severity fire in giant sequoia groves. The area in which the Redwood Fire is burning had already been identified by the parks as a high priority for fuels reduction, as it would provide protection for three groves at risk of catastrophic fire.  </p>\n\n<p>Fire managers plan to use a combination of hand and aerial ignitions to moderate fire behavior through areas with heavy fuels loads (for example, performing ignitions at the top of a slope to produce a backing fire, rather than allowing fire to run up a slope). The parks will continually evaluate current and anticipated fire behavior and are prepared to shift course if appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>This management strategy stands in contrast to the 2020 Castle Fire and the 2021 KNP Complex, which also began with lightning strikes in wilderness areas, but were met with immediate full-suppression efforts. Despite these efforts, those fires went on to burn with such dramatic severity that they killed thousands of mature giant sequoias, losses unprecedented in the trees’ history. The severity of these fires was driven in part by drought exacerbated by climate change, and in part by the density of the forest stands after many decades of fire suppression.  </p>\n\n<p>Park leadership stresses that not only are conditions dramatically different this year due to fuel moistures, with readily observable differences in fire behavior from the start, but also that fire-inclusive management in this area represents an invaluable opportunity to prevent catastrophic losses, like those seen in 2020 and 2021, from occurring in the future.  </p>\n\n<p>“Right now, we have better conditions than we’ve had in years to work with fire on the landscape,” said Superintendent Clay Jordan. “A confine and contain suppression strategy for the Redwood Fire is our opportunity to put the devastating lessons learned from the Castle Fire and the KNP Complex into practice. It is our responsibility as land managers to work with fire when we can, in order to prevent catastrophic losses like we saw in those fires.”  </p>\n\n<p>Smoke from the Redwood Fire is very visible from high vantage points throughout the Giant Forest and Lodgepole areas, including Moro Rock. Smoke impacts from the fire can be expected in the foothills of Sequoia National Park and the community of Three Rivers. The parks are working with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to mitigate smoke impacts to the extent possible.

Some of the fires are smaller, unnamed and are less accessible and are currently unstaffed as available resources focus on incidents of greater concern and greater likelihood of successful containment.  </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The South Fork Fire is located 5.5 miles west-southwest of Packwood, Washington, in the South Fork Williams Creek drainage. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The Carlton Ridge Fire is about ½-mile northeast of private property on Carlton Ridge, about 7.5 miles northwest of White Pass. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The Grassy Mountain Fire is located 4.5 miles northeast of Randle, Washington, on the northern slope of Grassy Mountain. The remote location, dense forest canopy, and steep terrain limit access to safely get fire crews in and out of the fire area. The Grassy Mountain fire is currently unstaffed.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The Snagtooth and Spencer Quartz Fires are located 21 miles south of Randle on the south side of Snagtooth Mountain. Together, they are the largest of the Cowlitz Complex fires.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><strong>Smoke Information</strong>: Visit <a href=\"https://www.airnow.gov/\">Airnow.gov</a> for current smoke conditions near you.  Expect valley fog in the morning, turning into clear skies and a mostly sunny day. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><strong>Closures</strong>: Due to fire activity on the Snagtooth Fire the following roads and trails are closed to the public to reduce exposure and help ensure public safety: Forest Roads 9300 and 9341, Boundary Trail #1 (from Elk Pass to intersection with Summit Prairie), Summit Prairie #2, Craggy Peak #3, Snagtooth #4, Quartz #5, Stabler Camp #17, Wright Meadows #80, Basin Camp #3A, Quartz #5B, Quartz #5C (French Creek), Snyder Pasture #80A.   For more information, please view the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1135686.pdf\">Forest Order</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1135687.pdf\">Forest Order Map.</a></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Additionally, Forest Road 8410 is closed in the vicinity of the Pothole Fire, and Forest Road 78 is temporarily closed between the 7802 junction and the 2278 junction due to hazardous debris rolling out onto the roadway.    </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><strong>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR):</strong> Two TFRs are in effect, one located north of US-12 to Mount Rainier National Park, and a new TFR south of US-12 to include Snagtooth and Spencer Quartz fires. View the TFR’s at the <a href=\"https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html\">Federal Aviation Administration Website.  </a> Fire aviation response is halted or delayed if an unauthorized aircraft enters the TFR. Temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned aircraft systems or drones. If you fly, we can’t!
