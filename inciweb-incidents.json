    "field_incident_overview": "<p>On May 8, 2023, conditions were good for ignitions to start on the Animas City Mountain. The project took the whole week to make sure the prescribed fire was an success. Ignitions were completed on Friday, May 12th, for a total of 495 acres treated. Firefighters patrolled and secured the edges for weeks after until moisture came into the area. Check out this YouTube video about the project <a href=\"https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv\">https://youtu.be/x78BLZyVvKA?si=g_B8r3rP_llqVZsv</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the risk of high-intensity wildfire, improve forest health and wildlife habitat, the Bureau of Land Management Tres Rios Field Office has planned a prescribed fire treatment for up to 652 acres on Animas City Mountain in Durango, Colorado. Dependent on weather and the availability of firefighters to conduct the operation, the prescribed burns could take place in spring and fall months. An Environmental Assessment which covers this, as well as other treatment areas in La Plata County, has been completed and is available here: <a href=\"https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1505044/510\">Final Environmental Assessment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires require a comprehensive plan consisting of 21 elements. The plan outlines the methodical process from inception to completion. The Animas City Mountain project is expected to take 2-3 days for ignitions, with additional time to patrol the area and extinguish hot spots. The mountain has been divided into seven units or compartments. Crews are expected to begin burning on the top of the mountain by slowly lighting an edge that has already been thinned with chainsaws. Once a secure edge or “black line” has been established, firefighters ignite the interior of each unit, one unit at a time. The fire then burns back toward the secured, black edge. This methodical approach allows firefighters opportunities to halt ignitions if burning conditions become undesirable. Examples of undesirable conditions are fire behavior that is too active/not active enough, and poor smoke dispersion. Firefighters will also have water on hand to cool things down if fire activity grows beyond a desirable level.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fires are watched carefully by firefighters around the burn, lookouts at more distant locations, aerially (helicopters, planes, drones), and with calibrated smoke monitors. These monitors will be placed at locations around the burn to track smoke impacts in real time. The BLM and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Air Quality (CPDHE) have been working since 2018 to develop a permit that accomplishes the burn while minimizing smoke impacts to the surrounding area. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</a>. Prescribed fires are a tool to minimize smoke impacts to communities by careful selection of when fires burn and when they stop. Firefighters utilize compartments to halt the fire from spreading overnight, whereas wildfire continue to burn overnight when smoke is likely to settle into low lying areas where communities are located. Residual smoke from the interior areas of the compartments is anticipated, but the goal is to start early in the day and stop early in the evening to give material as much time as possible to be consumed before night-time cooling occurs and smoke sinks into the valley.</p>\n\n<p>Ideal timing (windows) for the project occurs during the Spring and Fall when conditions are more favorable for low-intensity fire. Fuel (vegetation) and weather conditions must fall within a predetermined “prescription” that is known to yield desirable results while still being controllable by the fire personnel conducting the burn. Dissipation of smoke is also part of the prescription. Prescription development has been done by local fire experts who utilize fire behavior computer modeling software combined with decades of experience conducting prescribed burn in southwest Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>This project is a coordinated effort between the federal/county/local government, NGOs, emergency managers, fire departments, public health officials, state smoke regulators and nearby residents. The burn is planned to take place over the course of 2-3 days. Brief closure of Animas City Mountain during the ignitions will occur for public and firefighter safety. The containment lines used for the project will consist of BLM designated trails. The units will be ignited using a combination of ground and aerial resources and will be patrolled/mopped up until out.</p>\n\n<p>The project is part of the BLM’s ongoing commitment to protecting human health and safety while maintaining or enhancing forest and woodland health and functionality. The Animas City Mountain area was previously masticated in 2010 which altered the vertical structure of the forest stand to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Mastication is a treatment method where the understory is mowed and mulched with a large machine. The mulched material slowly decomposes, while the understory regrows. Mastication and prescribed fire are effective in preventing fires from leaving the ground and becoming “crown” fires where the entire trees or stand of trees burn. Treatments thin and remove some of the large dense understory or “ladder fuels”.</p>\n\n<p>Vegetation, however, grows back and requires maintenance. Prescribed fire is the best treatment option for this forest type, if possible, after the initial mechanical treatment. While consuming some of the standing vegetation; prescribed fire also eliminates material left on the ground from both mastication and the natural shedding of leaves, needles, etc. Fire is the only natural process used as a treatment method and produces the most effective results for hazardous fuel reduction while enhancing woodland health. Ponderosa pine woodlands are a drought resistant species that have evolved with a natural cycle of frequent, low-intensity fire.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed fire mimics this natural process and improves forage for wildlife, as well as increasing plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where grasses and flowers can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Every year the west is impacted by large catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and other treatment methods lessen the impacts of future fires and increase the likelihood firefighters can work safely and be effective at stopping fires in and near treated areas.</p>\n\n<p> </p>",

The prescribed burn projects will be on the Gunnison, Tres Rios and Uncompahgre Field Offices. The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  <br /><br />\nWhile no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. <br /><br />\nThe BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented.

Regularly conducting prescribed fires, which mimic nature, reduces the buildup of flammable vegetation and overgrowth.</span></p><p><span>﻿﻿To receive updates, follow us on </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001_4jQevMBOHm3ij4X-dPiBcWzTzhBlKNG7Ak20ATiL5hV8dbH0ztFvQihs44UwsWlSe5bGkI176N1h-l5TyqtuEYfaE-_LANcpc9obrtT3nKEAqFO18PTR_dqaAf8xPtNcyHOtfrqyMKc1KJyLkHLe0bNKsbpmaxc%26c%3Dtu6-bHUBD7B_o7CiWT7VjbjY3EQ2RGUdJBnV-2-5PJc7kz6ezD4ikQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DKkBmbkI9Pj8Pw596zy9vJ8hEwx5R_V70FL4MGPZT38jjcVXICPoHrQ%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C8d7f5e8910d04f77a0d108db467312f9%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638181304112273720%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=P1Ou3zBgeWBfIK4j%2BLeuEVKv5zx3UIfq4QcPlVYZJFY%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001_4jQevMBOHm3ij4X-dPiBcWzTzhBlKNG7Ak20ATiL5hV8dbH0ztFvQihs44UwsWlvNfg4L24yNGmpu9fPnYBAJtkHFFkIvXBbTSaxVAht5IWVcU3hkHisQptxY3jQ5vxqilRu7y7KVtWlVz_jX-eqQ%3D%3D%26c%3Dtu6-bHUBD7B_o7CiWT7VjbjY3EQ2RGUdJBnV-2-5PJc7kz6ezD4ikQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DKkBmbkI9Pj8Pw596zy9vJ8hEwx5R_V70FL4MGPZT38jjcVXICPoHrQ%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C8d7f5e8910d04f77a0d108db467312f9%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638181304112273720%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xYh6uQsYifWyNPeUQOlhzbPuxGpy9a2r5%2FcjrVk80B0%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><strong>X</strong></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001IYrlh1STq1nQ4D8XRO5B4Tvbd__skb5DEaSNzAHXRTWsJ95wGZldZ7zrkXvzVXksf3R6x_FiGGtTmBpzdxMnTnede0kaBf28EWf6JhMvjtJ1G2BxcsTGuuXwUui3wHLgc8u79l49Wyo2SYfQARrvjWhWttAZTbd2\"><span><strong>join our email list through Constant Contact</strong></span></a><span> and select list \"Forest Health &amp; Fire: North of Hwy 14 to Wyoming Border (Red Feather Lakes).\"</span></p>",

The strategy, called “</span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/Confronting-the-Wildfire-Crisis.pdf\"><span>Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A Strategy for Protecting Communities and Improving Resilience in America’s Forests</span></a><span>,” (</span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Confronting-Wildfire-Crisis.pdf\"><span>leer en español</span></a><span>) combines a historic investment of congressional funding with years of scientific research and planning into a national effort that will dramatically increase the scale and pace of forest health treatments over the next decade. Through the strategy, the agency will work with states, Tribes and other partners to addresses wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient.</span></p><p><span>In early 2023, the USDA Forest Service added </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/WCS-Second-Landscapes.pdf\"><span>11 additional landscapes</span></a><span>. This announcement followed a year of progress in collaborating with partners across 10 initial landscapes to address wildfire risk to infrastructure and communities. One of these 11 additional landscapes is the Cleveland National Forest. </span></p><p><span>Cleveland National Forest fire crews are starting to conduct fuel treatment operations. These projects will continue through 2023 and into spring 2024. These fuel treatment operations will include vegetation thinning, cutting and piling, mastication, prescribed fire by burning of piles, and low-intensity understory burning.  Fire and mechanical treatments are important tools for the Forest Service’s mission to reduce vegetation loading, and restore natural fire regimes, which in the long-term help communities live more safely in fire prone areas and improve forest health.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>The objective of the projects are to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape. In fiscal year 2023, the Forest's target for fuels reduction is 6,900 acres. 2,400 acres of planned prescribed fire, and 3,500 acres of mechanical treatments which is a combination of mastication, cut and pile with chainsaws.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted.

Under the umbrella of an Incident Management Organization (IMO), teams of drivers are systematically driving forest roads and assessing damage to roads, recreation sites, or OHV trails. Once located, the sites are turned over to other staff within the IMO equipped with chainsaws and shovels for fallen tree removal or to staff with back-hoe tractors, tracked excavators, and dump trucks. These equipment operators are smoothing out roads, filling erosion holes, cleaning debris from culverts, and generally doing what they can to fix the roads in a timely manner. Damaged sections that require a more substantial repair will be contracted through the Forest Engineer for more specialized contractors to completion.  Larger equipment has been requested to assist with road repairs.  </p>\n\n<h3><span><span><span><strong>Winter Road Closures</strong> </span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p><span><span><span>A forest closure order remains in effect through June 15th for the Western Divide and Kern River Ranger Districts of the Sequoia National Forest.  Full details available on the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1082404.pdf\">Sequoia National Forest Website.</a> These closures are designed to help protect road surfaces and natural resources.

    "field_incident_overview": "<p><span><strong>INCIDENT OVERVIEW</strong></span></p><p><span>This InciWeb page provides visitors and residents traveling to and recreating on the Inyo National Forest (Forest) following the recent historic winter precipitation over the Sierra Nevada.</span></p><p><span>The Forest encourages visitors to use this information so they may be prepared for potential hazards they may encounter, such as flooding, rock falls, fallen trees and other debris brought down by avalanches, and overall road damage.</span></p><p><span><strong>CURRENT SITUATION</strong></span></p><p><strong>Current Forest Road Conditions: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/alerts-notices/?cid=fseprd1074725\"><strong>www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/alerts-notices/?cid=fseprd1074725</strong></a></p><p><span>Forest Service Staff continues to assess road and recreation area conditions across the Inyo National Forest as conditions allow.</span></p><p><span>Forest Recreation Service staff continues to evaluate which facilities can be opened and accessed.</span></p><p><span><strong>GENERAL AREA CONDITIONS</strong></span></p><p><span>The winter of 2022-2023 is the largest recorded winter snowfall for California mountains, at 300% of average snowpack. The spring had been cool, limiting the snowmelt. However, weather forecast for early July has very warm temperatures for the area. This means there's a lot of snow out there to melt and could cause potential flooding and swift, cold water flows.</span></p><p><span>California’s historic snowpack is now starting to melt with warming springtime temperatures, causing the levels of creeks, streams, and rivers to rise significantly and flood some areas. According to the National Weather Service, the bulk of the flooding may happen in late May to early August, however it will continue to persist into fall because of the depth and density of the snowpack.</span></p><p><span><strong>INYO NATIONAL FOREST SNOWMELT FLOOD INFORMATION</strong></span></p><p><span>Inyo National Forest welcomes visitors to enjoy this unusually lush and beautiful spring and summer, but please proceed with caution. Not every trail or road has been surveyed and deemed “safe” to recreate on, so it is up to you to look out for your own safety and plan for any unexpected changes to your trip.</span></p><p><span>There is a heightened risk of flooding, landslides, debris flows, road/trail washouts and avalanches. And with the combination of extended hot weather and abundant snow means certain areas may remain above flood stage for some time.</span></p><p><span>Creeks and streams will be at higher flows for longer into the year, making them challenging or impossible to cross. Steep snowbanks on either side of streams and creeks may add additional challenges to crossing.</span></p><p><span><strong>Campgrounds:</strong></span></p><p><span>In addition to the prolonged presence of snow, downed trees, log jams, and rock falls are delaying the openings of many of the Forest’s campground facilities. Forest recreation staff are working with the concessionaires to clear these obstacles and get the campgrounds open as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span>Want to know the status of a campground? Please visit the Inyo National Forest’s </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recmain/inyo/recreation\"><span>RECREATION</span></a><span> page.</span></p><p><span><strong>Trails:</strong></span></p><p><span>The trails may also be heavily eroded, have mudslides, rockfalls, and/or downed trees and the work to repair them will be delayed as the Forest works hard with its partner organizations to triage and repair the most dangerous areas of trail that need it.</span></p><p><span>Keep in mind, Forest hiking trails are still covered in snow, and accessing some trailheads will be delayed or impossible as the snow continues to melt.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, there are still dangers of avalanches happening. Be sure to check on the Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center website on conditions before you go: </span><a href=\"http://www.esavalanche.org/\"><span>www.esavalanche.org</span></a></p><p><span>While hiking, it will be wet and muddy and may have sections of flowing or standing water on them. With that, the Forest does expect the mosquitoes to be out this year with force.</span></p><p><span><strong>HOW YOU CAN PREPARE</strong></span></p><p><span>As temperatures continue to rise, and the snow continues to melt, the National Weather Service (NWS) could issue flood advisories for the local forest area. Certain areas could come under flood warnings or watches, and the Forest will not be closing those areas because of that.</span></p><p><span>It is up to you to keep up on the flood advisories and make your plans accordingly. It might be a good idea to sign up for notifications from the NWS’s social media pages:</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/rev/\"><span>NWS Weather Forecast-Reno Office</span></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NWSReno\"><span>NWS-Reno Facebook</span></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/vef/\"><span>NWS Weather Forecast-Las Vegas Office</span></a><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NWSVegas\"><span>NWS-Las Vegas Facebook</span></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=37.37&amp;textField2=-118.4#.ZGP7Sk_MI2w\"><span>NWS Current Conditions-Bishop</span></a></li></ul><p><span>Forest visitors should be prepared for the possibility of road closures and tire chain requirements.

This change to a smaller organization was possible due to the successful suppression efforts; additional containment; and decreased fire behavior and intensity. </span></p><p>The Spring Creek Fire started on Saturday, June 24. Firefighters and aircraft worked to keep the fire to about 200 acres on a mix of private and Bureau of Land Management-administered land. Hot, dry, windy conditions aligned with terrain on June 26, causing the fire to make a significant run growing to more than 2,500 acres. Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team Two assumed command of the fire June 28. </p><p><span>The varied fuels and extreme terrain presented substantial challenges to firefighters during containment efforts. Crews used a variety of tactics including direct handline against the black fire’s edge and indirect tactics where terrain would not allow firefighters to safely engage.</span></p><p><span>Firefighters are now mopping up hotspots, providing suppression repair to disturbed firelines and patrolling firelines. Personnel are removing equipment no longer needed on the fireline. Smoke will be intermittently present for some time both from the smoldering fire and from exposed oil shale.</span></p><p>Spring Creek Road and High Mesa Road are open to restricted traffic only. Please avoid these areas if possible and drive with caution with increase in fire personnel on the roadway.</p><p><strong>Closures:</strong> There are no closure orders in place at this time. </p><p><strong>Evacuations:</strong> There are no evacuations at this time.

Call recorded message line at 970-981-3401 for current evacuation information</p><p><strong>Temporary Flight Restrictions:</strong> There is a TFR (FDC 03/0215) in place for air space over the Spring Creek Fire to reduce impacts to fire aviation operators.

The Forest extends great respect and gratitude towards the active work of firefighters in containing and controlling wildfires through techniques such as removing fuels, suffocating the fire with dirt, and cooling vegetation with targeted water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of families and communities taking a hands-on approach to wildfire preparedness, including creating defensible space around homes and buildings, making homes more fire-resistant, and having emergency plans in place. Several Nevadans live in a high-risk fire zone, making these efforts even more crucial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Service&#039;s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy is of the utmost importance for the HTNF with the announcement of 10 landscape project areas and the addition of 11 more in January 2023. These landscapes represent investments in high-risk fire sheds in the western United States, which are large, forested landscapes and rangelands with a high likelihood of destructive wildfires. The agency treated 3.2 million acres nationally in the previous year, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe encourage Nevadans to access the Living With Fire website, https://www.livingwithfire.com/, which provides local alerts, preparedness checklists, evacuation plans, and other resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON ALL HTF FIRE INCIDENTS - Please follow us on FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF and TWITTER https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember - Only you can prevent wildfires!",

After 12 hours of fire activity, the Lowline Fire was at 400 acres. Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the fire on July 28th at 7 a.m. On August 9th, management of the fire was transitioned to a Type 3 Team as fire behavior slowed and as the confine and contain management strategy for the fire reached 55% containment.

Smoke continues to be visible from County Road 730 and Ohio Creek and will likely persist until the area receives a season-ending weather event. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The Lowline Fire is a long-duration wildfire event that is currently being administered under a “confine and contain” management strategy. Using this strategy, firefighters concentrate their fire suppression and containment efforts around the values at risk to the north, east and south of the Lowline Fire. On the western edge of this fire, the goal is to confine fire growth toward the wilderness boundary, where fire can be helpfully utilized toward forest health and future fire suppression needs. This management strategy is also a safer and more effective use of firefighting personnel, as the western area of the Lowline Fire presents a significant safety risk to firefighters due to heavy amounts of dead and downed trees. Firefighter and public safety remain our priorities. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>All evacuation notices have been lifted for the Lowline Fire.

The fire was first spotted burning in heavy timber late afternoon on August 16 and quickly grew to about 100 acres the first evening.  The fire burned actively overnight and by the next day it was estimated to be about 1,690 acres and grew throughout the day. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Firefighting resources responded quickly to suppress by utilizing seven single engine air tankers and four large air tankers who dropped retardant continuously until daylight ended. Scooper planes, retardant planes, and helicopters will continue to be utilized to assist firefighters on the ground.  Crews consisting of about 20 people arrived as soon as they could and continue to arrive from around the country to aid the fight. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>By August 18 the fire was mapped at 2750 acres as crews continued to arrive and construct fireline with an anchor point at East Mountain repeater site. Aircraft and scooper planes flew throughout the day, but the fire spread to the north and east into the Middle Fork drainage.  As of Aug 19, an infrared flight mapped the fire at 4158 acres even as the higher humidities and a little moisture hit the fire in the evening.  </span></span></p>\n\n<p>The Great Basin Incident Management Type 2 Team took command of the fire on August 20 and had a good transition day with local fire managers to continue plans of suppressing the fire and keeping firefighters safe. </p>\n\n<p><span><span>An area closure took effect Aug 18, 2023 at 6:00pm: Order number 0402-04-102 and maps are available in the \"maps\" tab. </span></span></p>\n\n<p>From Saturday afternoon Aug 17, 2023 to Tuesday Aug, 22 the fire area received 2.23\" of rain.  Due to that rain firefighters stayed off of the wet muddy roads as much as possible in order to reduce damage that the vehicles could have caused. </p>\n\n<p>As some warming and drying occurred after the storm, crews re-engaged in suppression activities and mainly focusing on the western and northern edges of the fire perimeter. As of August 30th, the fire is 59% contained and crews have made good progress on containing the northern and western edges of the fire perimeter.  The uncontained portion of the fire is the eastern edge that is located in the Middle Fork Payette River Drainage.  That area is steep, rugged terrain, with limited access.  That area of the fire will continue to be monitored by personnel such as lookout and aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>Transfer of command back to the local district will occur on Wednesday 8/30 at 1800, and the closure area has been reduced.  See closure tab and order #0402-04-103. </p>",

The Roza Slope fire started about 1211 PM and the South Slope fire started about 1220 PM. The area is mainly managed by the Bureau of Land Management, with some private ownership.  BLM resources started working on the fires and called in local area resources to assist them including air resources for water and retardant drops where it was possible. The request for a type 3 Incident Management Team was also made due to the large number of firefighting resources that will be arriving overnight and on the morning of September 13. South East Washington Inter-Agency IMT team 2 will take control of the fire at 6 AM on 9/13/23. The fires will be managed as separate fires but under one management team.  There may be some sharing of crews based on the operational needs each day, and the skill sets of different teams.  </p>\n\n<p>This page will contain updates for both fires.</p>",

If conditions are appropriate, about 7,000 acres with the potential of up to 15,000 acres are planned to be burned over multiple days, reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfire and improving wildlife habitat. The project area includes Cow Creek, Calamity Creek, and Indian Creek. The Cow Creek Prescribed Burn is being accomplished using joint-agency fire resources, utilizing both aerial and hand ignitions, and is being closely monitored to ensure that the burn area remains within the designated boundaries. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prescribed burning is a tool that re-introduces fire into the ecosystem to promote and regenerate healthy trees and habitat conditions. This type of fire management strategy is important to maintain a fire-adapted ecosystem and is essential for wildfire prevention. Before conducting a prescribed burn, extensive planning takes place to establish proper parameters such as weather, fuel conditions, smoke dispersion, staffing, and other agency coordination. A prescribed fire is a planned fire used to accomplish management objectives. One of the objectives for this burn is to reduce the overgrown and crowded fuels in the area, therefore creating a mosaic landscape that is more resistant to catastrophic wildfire. This prescribed fire is also aiming to enhance productive vegetation in the oak brush and mountain shrub parts of the burn area, in order to increase habitat for wildlife and livestock.  </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Significant coordinating efforts occur with local landowners, protection partners, and other cooperating agencies to ensure the burn is conducted safely. The safety of firefighters and the public are the most important factors considered when planning prescribed fires. For more information on prescription burning and its use, please visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire\"><span>https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire</span></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dispersed recreation in the prescribed fire project areas may be impacted.

Smoke from the prescribed fire is being managed to have minimal impact on neighboring communities. Smoke may be visible in several communities, including Grand Junction, Whitewater, Gateway, Fruita, Delta, Montrose, and Norwood for multiple days. The public is advised not to call 911 for smoke regarding this prescribed burn. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For more information on how prescribed fire smoke may affect your health, please visit </span><a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health\"><span>https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health</span></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prescribed burn updates will be posted on the GMUG Fire Info page.

Without fire, hazardous fuels can build up and carry wildfire from the forest floor to tree canopies, creating extreme fire behavior that poses risk to firefighters, surrounding communities and natural resources. Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service’s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.</span></p><p><span>Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible “burn windows” in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.</span></p><p><span>Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted. Some smoke may be visible. People should not be alarmed as the fires are carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout prescribed fire operations.</span></p><p><span>Additional updates on prescribed burning will be shared on on this page and the forest’s social media on Twitter at </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwI5UW5IX9USXnRvgHLegKQ5IHVZ5BKNwyKUtdLE8CwgYIUO2Mt1i3S3fsv-xo_M5hAulYgdcWnheiIBIphhgAopwFJf7zuJmG%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=rOyrj4bdrmvE3sUPGfhsZWBSVmtU207Rc7%2FmHecNanE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://twitter.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span> and Facebook </span><a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001JYSlPa_F885TgbSiqqdjA0ewuCbUct42Eyz2gZbHSv88Dpc0DyK50tPMb3nI47lwiTwC5K-RFHQry_eaedXPjtasR8A8Aa6p4FFDfOlMyKiVITYWIV93ncx1V9pl4ftl_-oY5zmYTnXu8lWHXNWf6_EN67YKitt0%26c%3DDCGRbAkBb1kqn93TfKXMTMfYrVLYRcYvHS_plx8jP8uIxwS-4_9JcQ%3D%3D%26ch%3DyOyu-KUdDkTAM7UdEC4pWnNdwaJ5z9bT6P-Gvbc6zhx-Lb74n6DvPw%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccb52b817a0d24f78780708daf9a8b8a8%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C638096800284324769%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0j4mJWsYdg9DxkgTLYi2yHZOZWKjb%2BLdiT69a5P9U%2BU%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><span><strong>https://www.facebook.com/MendocinoNF</strong></span></a><span>.</span></p>",

The Rabbit Fire has grown to approximately 28 acres.

Fire managers continue to evaluate the Rabbit Wildfire to determine the initial and long-term risks associated with the wildfire. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis process considers of the firefighters and public safety, natural and cultural resources, and values to be protected. This revolving evaluation ensures fire managers apply a risk management process that minimizes unnecessary risk in wildfire response while maximizing the opportunities to achieve agency management objectives by providing for safety first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA significant role of the Forest Service is to manage natural resources on public lands, and the Rabbit Fire response decision includes objectives that include improving and enhancing natural resources while managing naturally occurring wildfires.

Firefighters are consolidating unburned fuels and felling hazard trees as the Rabbit Fire incident completes the active fire portion of the project. Emphasis has switched to mainly cleaning up control lines and beginning mop-up operations. At the outset, the plan for this fire was to eliminate excess fuel loading on a portion of forest that had not had a fire in nearly 100 years. That plan has come successfully to its expected conclusion, and as soon as safely possible, the forest will be returned to full visitation. Drivers are advised that Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway will require care and awareness as firefighters are using these areas as gathering points to conduct operations. Crews remain alert and extinguish smoldering material in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed Firefighters are focusing on safeguarding the fire's perimeter while clean-up of the forest floor continues. Hazard tree crews will work with traffic controllers to safely limit delays while cutting to reduce impacts to forest visitors. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of activities until the incident is closed. Visitors and travelers should be aware that smoke is expected to continue for several days. Potential smoke impacts on local communities should ease daily. Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today.  </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Monday 23rd, Morning update: </strong><span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective for the incident is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. The Rabbit Fire incident is winding down from a very successful day of ignitions and firing on Saturday. The team expertly used the weather, fuel conditions, and fire personnel to accomplish all the day’s objectives. Those activities tied in control lines and effectively put the incident into clean-up mode. Firefighters are now consolidating and burning piles of excess fuel, felling additional hazard trees, cleaning up control lines, and beginning mop-up operations. Crews will continue verifying and extinguishing smoke (smoldering material) in areas close to public use. Patrols of all fire lines and interior fuel pockets continue to confirm that unburned fuels are consumed. Firefighters will focus on continuing line maintenance and clean-up of the forest floor. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway may be expected if hazard trees are deemed too close to the road. Falling crews will attempt to keep delays as short as safely possible to limit inconvenience to forest visitors. The assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality will be advised of any activities until the incident is closed, and potential smoke impacts to local communities should ease daily going forward<strong>. </strong>Visitors are advised that smoke will continue for several days, possibly weeks. They are NOT reportable occurrences.</span></p><p><strong>Sunday 22nd, Morning update:</strong> <span>The Rabbit Fire Incident Type 4 team’s main objective is full suppression with significant resource enhancement. Active fire from firing and ignition operations performed yesterday continues to burn today in the interior. Fire behavior has increased slightly in intensity with the weather. The fire will continue to slowly creep and back into the interior fuel pockets with occasional single tree torching. Fire crews have accomplished incident ignition objectives and are working on additional tree falling, fire line fortification, and monitoring over the next week. Quail Flat, Kings Canyon Overlook, and Big Meadows Road off the Generals Highway still warrant extreme caution as fire crews continue falling large trees in these areas. Short delays on Generals Highway can be expected for firefighter and public safety. Crews are busy closing off lines around yesterday’s firing operations and overseeing fire growth to planned specific areas. Firefighting crews’ emphasis is now mainly on line maintenance activities. Patrols are monitoring all fire lines and interior fuel pockets within the fire burn area. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones assist with mapping and monitoring fire on tough/dangerous terrain. Today’s operations will be closely monitored by the assigned Air Resource Advisor and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for air quality and potential smoke impacts on local communities. Previous ignitions on the Rabbit Fire and the Big Stump prescribed fire will continue to see a clean-up of unburned fuels today. Ignitions have stopped on the Big Stump prescribed fire until more favorable conditions for ventilations occur, likely this coming weekend.</span></p>",
